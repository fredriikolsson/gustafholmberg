            Wandering through the dreamy forests and the wide open fields of my home town is where I find my inspiration to write. Growing up in Sweden, I have learnt the importance of nature and believe it to be an integral part of mankind's well-being. I see my music as a dedication to mother earth and everything she offers us mere morals.
