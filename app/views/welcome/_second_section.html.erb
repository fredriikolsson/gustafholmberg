          A few years back, I was staying in Edinburgh in search for any kind of inspiration. I found out about folk musician Nick Drake, and started researching his entire life. I immediately fell in love with his music. The combination of simplicity and odd alternate tunings has inspired me greatly through my own musical experience. I owe him everything.
